# Rick And Morty

## Motivation
This was my first experience with React and I use Rick and Morty API for it. I see a lot of people using n packages to build their stuff so I wanted to give a try in bilding things like a carousel and a pagination without any external library.

## Features
- Carousel to display data
- Fetch data using pagination
- Fetch data using search box

## Installation

This application requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) to run.

Download or clone the project on your machine, install the dependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd project_folder
npm install
```

### Development

By default the application will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
